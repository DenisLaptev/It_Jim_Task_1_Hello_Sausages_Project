Please make a function which will create a list of dicts which will contain the following information about the files: 
filename, left, right, top, bottom of each sausage. 
And the image itself, too.

Input of the function is the path to the folder with images. Output is a list like this:

 [{'file': SR1.png, 'coords': [left,right,top,bottom], 'img':  }, ...]

I will do the imports for you:

import numpy as np
from cv2 import imread
from os import walk
